The highest grossing year which is total box office by year is 2018. This record will not be broken for a very long time. The lowest is 1995. Tickets were cheaper back then. The lowest grossing year in the 2000s and 2010s in 2005. The reasoning is that all the big blockbusters came out the years before and the years after. In the 2010s, that would be
### Did the total tickets sold increase or decrease over time
This answer will suprise you. It is actually decreaseing. But is decreasing slowly. The most sold year for tickets was 2002. Why 2002. 2002 had big event movies for example Spider-Man 1, Star Wars Attack of the Clones, Men in Black II, Austin Powers, Signs, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings Two Towers and mid budget oringial movies oveprerfermed in reletive to their expectiations.

## Top Distributors

![](Top%20Distributors.png)

### What are the top grossing Distributors and the included total gross?

1. The top distrubtor is Disney. The reason they have Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar. I beleive this contuniue to grow escpically with the merger of 20th century fox
2.  Warner Bros is number two. Warner Bros movies have franchises that were box office success like Batman, Harry Potter, Wonder Woman, Matrix, Godzilla series and more. Harry Potter is the most successful franchise
3.  Sony has Colmbia Pucture. The movies are
4.  Universal is the second . The have franchises that wewre box office success like Fast ans Furious, Juraasic Park, Minions, and more. Univeral has Universal studios which helps make the Universal brand more popular in which can translating into watchinh universal movies
* Parmount . Their biggest franhise is the transformers series
*
*
* 

These are the franchise that overperformed. This doesn't count the fair share of bombs each distributor has. They higher the total gross. The more overperformce the movie had in box office. 

### What are the top grossing Distributors and the included average gross?


* Disney has some box office disappoints but not too much
* parasmount picture is number 2 
*
* Dreamworks is a number 2 brand from Disney for coming out with animated movies that famioliy can enjoy. With dreamwork people will know that they getting a familiy movie therefore that is why dreamworks has a good average gross
*
*

This shows that the higher the averager gross is per distrubtor. The less likely there are going to be box office flops from that distrbutor. This is a good thing becasue distrbutors can take risks and if the fiolm flops, the distrunbots wont lose as much money becasue their movies are consistenl;y successful.

This is to show how powerful a brand can get

### What is the top grossing genre and the included average gross?

People love musicals it’s just studios don’t really release musicals b ut when they do there is a demand for them.

Drama is low because people cant sit through drama movies. Dramam movies aren’t as engaging as the other genres

This means there is always going to be anudience for musical movies

Higher the average the less flops movies in the genre are going to get

## Top Grossing Ratings COMPLETED

![](Top%20Ratings.png)

### What is the top grossing ratings and the included total gross?

* PG13 has the highest total gross. Majority of the biggest franchises whether it is a superhero movie or a novel adaptation movie or an action movie, PG13 movies can draw all types of people and all ages, but that depends on the movie. The movies that broke box office records on opening weekends are PG-13 movies.
  
* R rated movies are near the top. R movies are a novelty to watch in theaters because of the higher barrier to entry due to movie theaters requiring people to be accompanied by someone that is 17 or older. R movies do have a novelty factor that you will not find in a PG13 whether it is the strong language, gruesome violence, or sexually suggestive content which can draw moviegoers. Comedies and Horror are the main genres that are rated R .The superhero R rated movies like Deadpool, Logan and Joker are the biggest contributors to its highest total gross which is more recent starting the mid 2010s.
  
* PG also has a high total gross. PG has lots of family friendly films that are not violent enough for a PG13 rating. Disney Pixar Dreamworks and Illumination have animated PG movies and franchises that broke box office records. The reason PG movies don’t make more than PG13 is because some people assume PG movies are for kids and will not watch them in theaters. PG movies have the potential to gross even more into the future.
  
* G rated movies have Disney and Pixar in which they make lots of money in the box office. There are not a lot of G movies being made nowadays. Family friendly movies are now being pushed over the edge with violence and adult jokes which warrants a PG rating nowadays. There is not really a huge difference between G and PG anymore.
  
* NC17 is a fascinating rating. There are not many NC17 movies because of the total restrictions. Because of restricting the movies to the general young audience, NC17 movies don't make a lot of money. Studios want that younger audience because they make more money like the PG13, PG, and G movies. This is the reason why studios will make some censorship for a movie to at least get an R rating.
  
* NR Not Rated are treated as a R Rating but studios want at least a rating.
  
### What is the top grossing ratings and the included average gross?

* PG13 is still at the top. A Lot of franchises are always getting PG13 ratings like comic book movies, action, fantasy and book adapted movies. The movies can be unsuitable for younger views but not crazy enough for a R rating. It is just more high budget blockbusters that get PG13 ratings but it is changing since PG, G, and R Rated movies have some movies that are higher budget and overperformed and make at a billion or almost a billion dollars in the box office.

* PG is consistently grossed higher. PG has more family friendly films than PG13 but those movies are not known for opening big. They just have better holds in the long run meaning the movies are still popular like a month after release. A PG rating is for sure letting families know that this movie is suitable for children.

* G rated is lower because it is mainly Disney movies that carry this and not many movies come out with this rating.

* R movies have a bigger barrier to entry. Movie theaters have to restrict under 17 to these movies. Studios miss out on potential revenue from making it more accessible to the general audience. R rated movies don’t make as much money consistently as the PG13, PG and G rated movies.

* The reason for NC17's huge drop off is because of the reputation that the movie for sure has contents that are unsubtle for the general audience. People will think that NC17 is like rated X and that rating is a big no no for the general audience. Because of the low average gross, studios will not make NC17 movies for theaters. I have never seen a NC-17 movie playing in theaters in like 20 years. 

## Top Grossing Sources

![](Top%20Sources.png)

### What are the top 6 top grossing sources and the total gross included?


* Original screenplly has so many movies that they make so much money becasure there are so many movies
* YA genres play are role in this Baed on fiction story. Example is Twilight and Hunger Game series
* Comic book movies Becasue the were not many comic book movies coming out compared to now. MCU did not start unitl Iron Man 1. 
* Remakes are a pretty recent phohnen
* Overall movies are either oringial or theey are adapted from other source material

### What are the top 6 top grossing sources and the Average gross included?

* Comic book movies are a no-brainer that they are on top. Comic book movies always consistently make the most money. People love comic book movies from all ages from kids to adults. I see a lot of superhero toys and merchandise in the kids sections in stores. This also explains why Disney bought Marvel. About once a year, at least one Marvel movie is guaranteed to come out.  DC does have some hit or miss movies box office wise but they still generate a lot of money because people love Superman, Batman, Joker, etc. Comic book movies are here to stay even after the success of Avengers Endgame
* Spin Offs are popular because it is attached to a main franchise that the audience are very familiar with.  
* Basded to TV is up there to.
* BAsed on Folk Tale.Legend and Fairytale is higher becasue Disney movies domainate and their are families that will take their kids to the movies if they see a movie being made by disney
* Remakes are a hit or miss to the genral audience. There are some remakes they want but there are those were they don't want them. Audeinde is more skeptical to remakes
* Based on books is carred by Lord of the Rings Harry Potter but are declinig becasue not as much of these movies are coming out recentl 
* Oringial screenly is alot more difficiult to get the genral audience to watch in theaters becasue they are unfamiliar with the material but directors and indie sutidios are releasing more originakl movies 
* Overall movies are either oringial or theey are adapted from other source materials

## Top Production Methods COMPLETED

![](Top%20Production%20Methods.png)

### What are the top 3 productions methods and total gross?

* Live Action is on top. It is cheaper to make. Studios can just pay for the crew and the location and not do any additional work like animating. And there are just a lot of live action movies being made therefore live action movies have big box office numbers.
* Live Action/Animation is near the top. The can be a movie with lots of CGI or a live action mixed with animation like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Space Jam, and the Disney live action remakes which is more recently into the 2010s
* Digital animation and the other types of animation included are lower. Animation in general, the movies don't have the highest total gross because animation has a reputation of a genre that only kids can enjoy which can turn away any older person.

### What are the top 3 productions methods andaverage gross?

* The live action animation mix is on the top. It is because of the familiar material to them that will always get them to the theater. The biggest success of this is the live action Disney Renaissance remakes like Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and other remakes like Cinderella and Jungle Book. These are mixed with live animation and cgi. Disney is not done yet with their live action remake slate because they are consistently successful.
*  Digital animation is near the top because those movies attract a family friendly audience and parents just want to leave the house and go to the theater to entertain their kids. And digital animations are not usually the biggest opening weekend but they stay in theaters for a long time and people go to these movies maybe later in the movies’ life 
*  Live action is lower because I believe that most live action movie can be put in the category of original screenplay in which is is more difficult to get a general audience to go to a movie theater to watch that content due to the unfamiliarity in the source material and justifying an increasing ticket prices to watch those films
