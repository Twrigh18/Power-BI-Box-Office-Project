## Top Distributors

### What are the top grossing Distributors and the included total gross?

1. The top distrubtor is Disney. The reason they have Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar. I beleive this contuniue to grow escpically with the merger of 20th century fox
2.  Warner Bros is number two. Warner Bros movies have franchises that were box office success like Batman, Harry Potter, Wonder Woman, Matrix, Godzilla series and more. Harry Potter is the most successful franchise
3.  Sony has Colmbia Pucture. The movies are
4.  Universal is the second . The have franchises that wewre box office success like Fast ans Furious, Juraasic Park, Minions, and more. Univeral has Universal studios which helps make the Universal brand more popular in which can translating into watchinh universal movies
* Parmount . Their biggest franhise is the transformers series
*
*
* 

These are the franchise that overperformed. This doesn't count the fair share of bombs each distributor has. They higher the total gross. The more overperformce the movie had in box office. 

### What are the top grossing Distributors and the included average gross?


* Disney has some box office disappoints but not too much
* parasmount picture is number 2 
*
* Dreamworks is a number 2 brand from Disney for coming out with animated movies that famioliy can enjoy. With dreamwork people will know that they getting a familiy movie therefore that is why dreamworks has a good average gross
*
*

This shows that the higher the averager gross is per distrubtor. The less likely there are going to be box office flops from that distrbutor. This is a good thing becasue distrbutors can take risks and if the fiolm flops, the distrunbots wont lose as much money becasue their movies are consistenl;y successful.

This is to show how powerful a brand can get

Adventure. Harry potter and lord of the rings can be a contrubtuor. Action is number 2 and movies such as Mission Impoosible BOurne series, and John Wick haveiliy contribute to a high total gross for action

### What is the top grossing genre and the included average gross?

People love musicals it’s just studios don’t really release musicals b ut when they do there is a demand for them.

Drama is low because people cant sit through drama movies. Dramam movies aren’t as engaging as the other genres

This means there is always going to be anudience for musical movies

Higher the average the less flops movies in the genre are going to get

## Top Grossing Ratings

![](Top%20Ratings.png)

### What is the top grossing ratings and the included total gross?

* PG13 has the highest total gross. Majoirty of the bigggest frnachises whther it a superhero movie or a novel apdeapted movie or an action movie. PG13 movies can draw all types of people and all ages, but that depends on the movie. 

* R movies are number 2. R movies are a novelty to watch in theater becasue of higher barreir to entry due to movie theater requiring people to be accqimned by someone that is 17 or older. R movies do have a novelty factor that will not find in a PG13 wherther it is strong laguage, grusome violence, or sexually suggestive conent. which can draw moviegoers.

* The movies the gross the most are pg movies. PG has lots of fmailiy feriendly films.
* 
* R has some high grossers like Deadpool Matrix Logan It. These movies over performed in the box office which can result for R having a very high totqal gross. Pg has a 

G has Disney and pixar in which they make lots of money in the box office. There is not alot of G movies 

* NC17 is a fansicnating rating. There are not many NC17 Becasue of the total restrictions. Becasue of restricytroing the audience, NC17 movies don't make money. Studios want that younger audience becasue they make money . This is the reason why studios will make cesnors for a movie to at least get an R rating.

### What is the top grossing ratings and the included average gross?

* pG13 is still the top. Alot of franchises are always getting PG13 reatings. The movies can be unsuable for younger views but not crazy enough for a R rating.


Pg is consinten;y grosses gighr. PG has more family friendly films than PG13

The reason for NC17 uge drop off because of the repution that it for sure has contents that are unsubtle of gernel audience. People will think that NC17 is like rated X and that rating is a big no no for the genral audeince. Becasue of the low average gross, studios will not make NC17 movies.

## Top Production Methods

![](Top%20Production%20Methods.png)

### What are the top 3 productions methods and total gross?

*  Live Action is the top. It is cheaper to make. Studeios can just pay for the crew and the location and not do any additional work like anymating. And there just a lot of live action movies being made therefore live action movies have big box office numbers.
*  Live Action/ Animation. The can be a movie with lots of CGi or a live action mixed with animation like Who Framded Rodger rabbit.
* Digtial animation. Animation in general  moviesdont have the highest total gross is becasue animation has a repution of a genre that only kids can enojy which can turn anyway an older person.

### What are the top 3 productions methods andaverage gross?

* The live action animation mixed. Some movies can pull this off with being into the familiy friendly category
*  The other animation movies has becasue of the reputation of being familiy frienly in which can tranlate into moviegoers 
*  * Live action is lower becasue I beielve that most live action movie can be put in the category of oribiagl screenplay in which is is more difficult to get a genrwal audience to go to a movie theater to watch that conent due to the unflamiliarity in the source material
